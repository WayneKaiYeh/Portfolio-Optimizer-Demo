# 📈 Portfolio Optimization Demo

This repository demonstrates a constraint-based portfolio optimization engine with full CI/CD automation.  
It supports both **Sharpe Ratio Maximization** and **Minimum Volatility Allocation**, with results visualized daily and published to a cloud dashboard.

> This is a **public demo repository** — the full codebase is kept private.  
> Contact me directly if you wish to discuss implementation details.

## 🚀 Features

- Constraint-based optimizer using `cvxpy`
- Supports max-Sharpe and min-volatility strategies
- Custom asset bounds, turnover control, and flexible constraints
- Efficient frontier visualization with random portfolios
- Daily CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Cloud dashboard auto-deployment (Render.com)

## 🧱 System Pipeline
```
Edit tickers.json → GitHub Sync → GitHub Actions (00:00 UTC)
   ⬇

## 📁 Sample Allocation Files

- [`max_sharpe_allocation.csv`](./Output/max_sharpe_allocation.csv)
- [`min_vol_allocation.csv`](./Output/min_vol_allocation.csv)

These files include daily asset weights generated by the optimizer.

## ⚙️ Automation Flow (CI/CD)

1. GitHub Actions runs optimization script daily (00:00 UTC)  
2. Portfolio data fetched and cleaned  
3. Optimized weights calculated (Sharpe / Vol)  
4. Visuals and CSVs exported to `/Output/`  
5. Dashboard auto-deployed via Render
